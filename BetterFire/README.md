# BetterFire

### Description

Minecraft-like fire system, meaning if you kill an animal by fire it will drop cooked meat.

### Details

⚠ This version has a lot of bugs that idk how to fix, it includes: cooked food not dropping from animals that died from continuous fire; animals not
being set on fire if they have enough hp to die from one hit resulting in raw meat drop ⚠

❗ Only host needs to have a mod for it to work, if host doesn't have it but others do, game will still drop raw meat. ❗

Currently implemented features:

- Cooked variants of meat, drumsticks, etc.

Planned:

- Drop resin if Spinifex Tuft was broken by flaming bat
